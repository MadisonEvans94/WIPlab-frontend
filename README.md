# WIPlab (Frontend)

WIPlab is a passion project I'm working on, which is an innovative platform designed for musicians and producers to collaborate on _works in progress_ (WIPs). At WIPlab, artists can post their unfinished tracks, allowing other talented creators to bid for a chance to collaborate. This open-source project focuses on the frontend aspect of WIPlab, crafted with TypeScript and Next.js, setting the stage for an engaging and intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run WIPlab's frontend locally, make sure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

To get WIPlab up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will launch WIPlab on `http://localhost:3000`, where you can begin exploring the frontend.

## Usage

Currently, the WIPlab frontend is in its early stages. The interface allows for:

Further functionalities, including user account management and track submission, are under development.
